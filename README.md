### PDB_Cov
* Running 2.1.3.Curation.ipynb requires two other files.
  * data/faulty_adduct.txt  collects all false adducts, resulted from false covalent bond records in PDB archive. I curated the list manually and checked every adduct instance.
  * data/knowledge_base.txt collects covalent binders curated manually.
