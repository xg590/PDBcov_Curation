### PDB_Cov
* Running <b>2.1.3.Curation.ipynb</b> requires two other files.
  * <b>data/faulty_adduct.txt</b> collects all false adducts, resulted from false covalent bond records in PDB archive. I curated the list manually and checked every adduct instance.
  * <b>data/knowledge_base.txt</b> collects covalent binders curated manually.
